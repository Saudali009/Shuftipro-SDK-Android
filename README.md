# Request Parameters 

It is important to note here that each service module is independent of other and each one of them is activated according to the nature of request received from you. There are a total of four services which include face, document, address, consent.

All verification services are optional. You can provide Shufti Pro a single service or mixture of several services for verifications. All keys are optional too. If a key is given in document or address sevice and no value is provided then OCR will be performed for those keys.

String error = responseSet.get("error");

Log.e("LoggingResp", error);

//To get the status of request
 String event = responseSet.get("event");
 
	if(event.equalsIgnoreCase("verification.accepted")){
	
	//Verification accepted do whatever you want to do
		Log.i("LoggingResp", event);
	}else{
	
	//Verification declined do whatever you want to do
	Log.i("LoggingResp", event);
	}

```
**Note:** Run project on a real device.

## Status Response
The Shufti Pro Verification API will send a JSON response if a status request is made.

* <h3>reference</h3>
	Your unique request reference, which you provided us at the time of request, so that you can identify the response in relation to the request made.

* <h3>event</h3>

	This is the request event which shows status of request. Event is changed in every response. Please consult 
	[here](https://github.com/Saudali009/Shuftipro-SDK-Android/blob/master/status_codes.md) for more information

<aside class="notice">
Note: <b>request.invalid</b> response with <b>HTTP status code 400</b> means the request is invalid.
